# Course JSON Generator

by AdmiJW

Universiti Teknology Malaysia had many schools, each school is responsible for several programmes, and every semester, each school will release their own timetable of the courses in order for the students to do pre-registration and registration. 

Here's an example of such timetable:

_(This is schedule list from School of Chemical & Energy Engineering - 2021/2022 Semester 1)._

The schedule usually comes in the form of pdf, and different school will have different format of them. Therefore, attempting to convert them into some unified format, like `.json`, will mostly take manual work.

This application, __Course JSON Generator__ relieves the manual work by providing a better UI and workflow instead of having to convert the schedule into `.json` by typing inside some text editor.
